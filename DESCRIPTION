Title: INTEGRATION OF GENETIC ASSOCIATIONS WITH NETWORK DIFFUSION
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Daniel", "Lancour", email = "lancour@bu.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This package is intended as a framework for integrating genetic 
    findings with functional linkage evidence in a network. All that is required
    is a set of gene-level significance measures from a study, for example a 
    Genome Wide Association Study, and a set of user-specified known phenotype
    genes. From there, this package will re-prioritize the genetic data by 
    determining which genes have close diffusion proximity to the known genes.
